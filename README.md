# Information-Retrieval-System-Lucene

In this project I have implemented a basic information retrieval system using Apache Lucene 5.4.0.
This system provides multi field indexing, document retireval, and system evaluation feature.
The system is based on CISI doc collection. However, you can implement the understandCISIcollection() method in the way you want to parse your docs.
